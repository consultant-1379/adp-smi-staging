# Directory structure for the mocked help contents

Put files that need to be served by the mock service as ZIPs here, under the following path:
[package name]\[document path]\[zip name without the zip extension]\

Everything under that path will be served in a zip file. ZIPs returned for unspecified paths
will contain the contents of the default directory.
